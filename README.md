# Productivity Extension


The Productivity extension contains a number of productivity-related features to make the everyday store administration tasks easier. It includes one-click switching between the front- and back-end views of products, categories and CMS pages, a front-end toolbar for simple product editing without back-end access and a number of useful widgets.

## Front-end features

The toolbar is shown in Product, Category and CMS pages in the front-end for all authorised^ users. It contains a number of buttons that give access to the following functionality:

* Shortcut to the corresponding page (product, category or CMS page) in the back-end#.
* Shortcut to Google Analytics.

   # *This functionality is only enabled if the user is currently logged in to the back-end with an administrative account in the same browser.*
	

### Image Editing Toolbar

The toolbar is shown when the mouse pointer is hovering over a product image (main image or a thumbnail) in the Product page^. It allows simple image editing functionality:
* Delete and rotate product images
* Set main product image

**Note:**

   ^ The toolbar is enabled by default but only configured for the default theme. Custom themes with modified HTML layout or product image sizes require additional configuration, as outlined in XXX.
