# Productivity Extension


The Productivity extension contains a number of productivity-related features to make the everyday store administration tasks easier. It includes one-click switching between the front- and back-end views of products, categories and CMS pages, a front-end toolbar for simple product editing without back-end access and a number of useful widgets.

## Front-end features

### Productivity Toolbar

The toolbar is shown in Product, Category and CMS pages in the front-end for all _authorised_ users. It contains a number of buttons that give access to the following functionality:

* Edit product details, prices, attributes, etc.
* Upload product images.
* List products with missing images.
* Shortcut to the corresponding page (product, category or CMS page) in the back-end.
* Shortcut to Google Analytics.
* Help on using the extension.

**Note:**
  
   1. Only customers who are members of the _Reviewer_ group will get access to the front-end toolbar.     
   2. Shortcuts to the admin part of the website are only enabled if the user is currently logged in to the back-end with an administrative account in the same browser.
	

### Image Editing Toolbar

The toolbar is shown when the mouse pointer is hovering over a product image (main image or a thumbnail) in the Product page. It allows simple image editing functionality:
* Delete and rotate product images
* Set main product image

**Note:**

   Image editing toolbar may not always work in custom themes (with modified HTML layout or product image sizes) and may require some additional configuration, as outlined in XXX.
	
## Back-end features

#### Back-end to Front-end shortcuts

_FrontShop Preview_ button is added to Product editing, Category editing and CMS page editing views to allow one-click preview in the front-end.

Use middle button on your mouse in lists to open the item in a new window.
E.g. list of attributes in Attribute Set page, list of CMS pages, etc.
